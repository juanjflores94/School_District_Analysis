# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the same data. We performed the same analysis that we completed on the module. We analyzed the data by looking at the following: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Results

Much of the metrics from the original analysis remained the same. This makes sense given that we had a large set of data, and removing only a small portion of the data (math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School) would not drastically skew the data. Below is the table from the original analysis, which includes the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.

In the table below we removed the math and reading scores from Thomas High School. With the removal of the math and reading scores the data stayed pretty similar. The average numbers did get impacted.

## Summary
The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. Since the population amount was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages.
